       Hello  I'm [Your Name], a young front-end developer who is passionate about clear code, user-friendly design, and addressing practical problems.

 I just finished the SheCodes Basics and Plus workshops, where I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integrations to create a number of interactive projects.  My sense of user-friendly design has improved as a result of these experiences, and I now know how to combine creativity with functionality on the web.

 With a solid background in front-end technologies and a developing passion for technology, I'm now hoping to be a part of a team that values both creativity and learning.  This portfolio provides an overview of my previous work and a sneak peek at the enthusiasm, interest, and dedication I put into each project.
