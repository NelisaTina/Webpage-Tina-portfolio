      Chicken is a popular protein choice, owing to its ease of preparation and
      lean profile. Chicken has a reputation for being bland, yet this could not
      be further from the truth. Whether you favour juicy chicken thighs or soft
      chicken breasts, there are numerous simple ways to spice up the meat and
      make it a winning lunch or dinner. We recommend starting with the Tuscan
      Chicken Skillet. It's loaded with bacon, cream, and Parmesanâ€”is your mouth
      watering yet? There's no reason to eat out when you can prepare this
      restaurant-style creamy, cheesy chicken with fettuccine at home.
